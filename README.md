## It is a try for Iranian car Auto detection (type and model) on [this](https://github.com/mozanunal/yoloOnGoogleColab) project:

> # Run YOLO V3 on Colab for images/videos
> 
> Hello there, Today, we will be discussing how can we use the Darknet
> project on Google Colab platform. For those who are not familiar with
> these terms:
> 
> - The Darknet project is an open-source written in C, which is a framework to develop deep neural networks.
> - Yolo V3 is an object detection algorithm. It is one of the state of the art solution when **accuracy/processing power needed** metric is
> considered.
> - Google Cola is a cloud-based data science workspace similar to the jupyter notebook. Each Collabrotary session is equipped with a virtual
> machine running 13 GB of ram and either a CPU, GPU, or TPU processor.
> In most case, all the required packages are already installed on these
> machines and you can quite easily start development using Google
> Collaboratory. It saves us from installing process and it provides
> us **easy to accessible GPU's** which is also **free** under some
> constraints.
> 
> Have a look Ted Talk by Joseph Redmon the developer of the darknet
> project. The talk is about Darknet and YOLO projects which titled as
> “How computers learn to recognize objects instantly” . Darknet project
> aims to create a new neural network framework which is completely
> focused on simplicity and performance. The thing which I like about is
> its clarity and performance. All the code is written in C, to define a
> deep learning network you should only create a config file which
> defines the layers. By this way, it does not lose its performance
> capabilities also it provides us easy to use interface for development
> with this library.
> 
> Since I love both YOLO project and Google Colab, I decided to create a
> tutorial to use them together. I create a GitHub repository and a
> Collaboratory notebook for this purpose
